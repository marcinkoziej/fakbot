# Fakbot - the Faktura (Invoice) bot

This is a bot that fetches invoices from services. ðŸ¤–  ðŸ§¾

It exists because providers suck and do not send invoices via email, nor provide APIs to get them.

If you are annoyed to click through every month to fetch invoice PDFs - fakbot is for you.

```
npm i fakbot@0.1.0-beta.1
